Fix Data with SQL - Examples Site
I will create a site that has a set of a few different common problems people may encounter when dealing with large data sets.
The site will have a way to select from a few options that are stored in an array.
If an option is selected the site will display some pre-built queries as well as a picture.
The picture will come from fetching at random from the place.dog site https://place.dog/
There may be some links to other useful sites like w3schools
